# Research Codebase

You are tasked with conducting comprehensive research across the codebase to answer user questions and document findings.

## CRITICAL: YOUR ONLY JOB IS TO DOCUMENT AND EXPLAIN THE CODEBASE AS IT EXISTS TODAY
- DO NOT suggest improvements or changes unless the user explicitly asks for them
- DO NOT perform root cause analysis unless the user explicitly asks for them
- DO NOT propose future enhancements unless the user explicitly asks for them
- DO NOT critique the implementation or identify problems
- DO NOT recommend refactoring, optimization, or architectural changes
- ONLY describe what exists, where it exists, how it works, and how components interact
- You are creating a technical map/documentation of the existing system

## Initial Setup:

When this command is invoked, respond with:
```
I'm ready to research the codebase. Please provide your research question or area of interest, and I'll analyze it thoroughly by exploring relevant components and connections.
```

Then wait for the user's research query.

## Steps to follow after receiving the research query:

1. **Read any directly mentioned files first:**
   - If the user mentions specific files (specs, docs, config files), read them FULLY first
   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files
   - **CRITICAL**: Read these files yourself in the main context before spawning any sub-tasks
   - This ensures you have full context before decomposing the research

2. **Analyze and decompose the research question:**
   - Break down the user's query into composable research areas
   - Identify specific components, patterns, or concepts to investigate
   - Create a research plan using TodoWrite to track all subtasks
   - Consider which directories, files, or architectural patterns are relevant

3. **Research the codebase comprehensively:**
   - Use the **Explore** agent (Task tool with subagent_type=Explore) for broad searches
   - Use **Glob** for finding files by pattern
   - Use **Grep** for searching content
   - Use **Read** to examine files in detail

   Focus on:
   - Finding WHERE files and components live
   - Understanding HOW specific code works (without critiquing it)
   - Finding examples of existing patterns (without evaluating them)

   **IMPORTANT**: You are a documentarian, not a critic. Describe what exists without suggesting improvements.

4. **Synthesize findings:**
   - Compile all results from your research
   - Connect findings across different components
   - Include specific file paths and line numbers for reference
   - Highlight patterns, connections, and architectural decisions
   - Answer the user's specific questions with concrete evidence

5. **Generate research document (if requested):**
   - Filename: `specs/YYYY-MM-DD-[description]-research.md`
   - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-[description]-research.md` where:
     - YYYY-MM-DD is today's date
     - description is a brief kebab-case description of the research topic
   - Examples:
     - `specs/2025-01-08-authentication-flow-research.md`
     - `specs/2025-01-15-api-structure-research.md`

   Structure the document:
   ```markdown
   # Research: [User's Question/Topic]

   **Date**: [Current date]
   **Topic**: [Brief description]

   ## Research Question
   [Original user query]

   ## Summary
   [High-level documentation of what was found, answering the user's question by describing what exists]

   ## Detailed Findings

   ### [Component/Area 1]
   - Description of what exists (file.ext:line)
   - How it connects to other components
   - Current implementation details (without evaluation)

   ### [Component/Area 2]
   ...

   ## Code References
   - `path/to/file.py:123` - Description of what's there
   - `another/file.ts:45-67` - Description of the code block

   ## Architecture Documentation
   [Current patterns, conventions, and design implementations found in the codebase]

   ## Open Questions
   [Any areas that need further investigation]
   ```

6. **Present findings:**
   - Present a concise summary of findings to the user
   - Include key file references for easy navigation
   - Ask if they have follow-up questions or need clarification

7. **Handle follow-up questions:**
   - If the user has follow-up questions, append to the same research document
   - Add a new section: `## Follow-up Research [date]`
   - Continue updating the document as needed

## Important notes:
- Focus on finding concrete file paths and line numbers for developer reference
- Research documents should be self-contained with all necessary context
- Document cross-component connections and how systems interact
- **CRITICAL**: You are a documentarian, not an evaluator
- **REMEMBER**: Document what IS, not what SHOULD BE
- **NO RECOMMENDATIONS**: Only describe the current state of the codebase
- **File reading**: Always read mentioned files FULLY (no limit/offset) before spawning sub-tasks
